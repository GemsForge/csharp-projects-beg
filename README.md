# C Sharp Projects for Begginners
This repository contains basic projects including the popular FizzBuzz coding challenge.

## FizzBuzz Game - Divisibility Challange 🕹️
### Description
The FizzBuzz Game is a classic coding challenge that tests basic programming skills. The rules are simple:

Enter 5 numbers between 1 and 100.
For each number:
- "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5 (10 points).
- "Fizz" if divisible by 3 (5 points).
- "Buzz" if divisible by 5 (5 points).
- Otherwise, 1 point.

### Tehnical Notes 💻
- **Model Class (FizzBuzz):** Encapsulates game logic by determining "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "Number" with associated points.
- **Service Class (FizzBuzzService):** Handles core game logic, storing user inputs, and tallying points.
- **Interactive CLI:** Provides an engaging user experience, displaying rules and collecting validated inputs.
- **XML Documentation:** Comprehensive code comments using XML, aiding in understanding and maintaining the codebase.

- ** OG Rules**:
Fizz Buzz Problem states that given an integer n, for every integer i <= n, the task is to print “FizzBuzz” if i is divisible by 3 and 5, “Fizz” if i is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if i is divisible by 5 or i (as a string) if none of the conditions are true.
